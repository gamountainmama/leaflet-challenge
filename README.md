# leaflet-challenge

I created a Leaflet map using JavaScript for the earthquake data from the USGS at http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.

I created a toggle for the user to choose a street map or a topographic map, and layers for earthquakes in the past hour, day, week, and month.
